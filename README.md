# larrywang-portfolio

This is the repository for my personal website, containing everything about me. I want to be able to showcase all of it in a single place. This site is part of my journey toward becoming skilled in Full-Stack development. I chose to build it while learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I’m also using this README to keep track of my learning progress — both for myself and for anyone who might find it helpful. Once the website is finished, I plan to host it on GitHub Pages.

## 📚 Learning Progress

I’m currently following these learning paths:

- [freeCodeCamp Full Stack Developer Curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) (fcc-FSD) — started 4/12/25
- [Comm 244](http://web.simmons.edu/~grovesd/comm244/): *Design for the World Wide Web* — started 5/20/25

I'm also interested in exploring the [Odin Project Paths](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths). Once I complete fcc-FSD and Comm 244, I plan to continue with either the Ruby on Rails or JavaScript path.

## 🗓️ Weekly Progress

Each section starts on a **Monday** and should be completed by **Sunday night**. This helps me stay on pace and accountable.
