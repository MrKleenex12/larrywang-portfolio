# larrywang-portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built as part of my journey to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I plan to host it on GitHub Pages when finished.
## Learning Progress  
I’m following the [freeCodeCamp Full Stack Developer Curriculum] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) to build a solid foundation in web development.

### Current Progress:
- Basic HTML and HTML5
- Basic CSS
- Applied Visual Design
- **HTML Forms and Tables** – currently on:  
  **Lecture – Working with Forms**

As I learn, I’ll keep updating this site with new features and improvements based on the skills I gain.

## Future Goals
- Add interactive JavaScript features  
- Complete the Responsive Web Design Certification  
- Continue building projects and showcasing them
