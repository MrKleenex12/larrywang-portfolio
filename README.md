# larrywang-portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built as part of my journey to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I plan to host it on GitHub Pages when finished.

## Learning Progress

I am following these learning courses:

- freeCodeCamp Full Stack Developer Curriculum (FCC-FSD) [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/] - started 4/12/25
- Comm 244: Design for the World Wide Web [http://web.simmons.edu/~grovesd/comm244/] - started 5/20/25

I am also interested in following the the Odin Project paths at [https://www.theodinproject.com/paths]. I will jump into either the Ruby on Rails or the JavaScript path after finishing the FCC-FSD and Comm 244 courses.

### Current Progress

- FCC-FSD: Forms and Tables (In Progress)
- Comm 244: Week 1 (Finished)

I will update my progress as I go learn more.

## Future Goals

- Add interactive JavaScript features
- Complete the Responsive Web Design Certification
- Complete COMM 244: Design for the World Wide Web
- Continue building projects and showcasing them
