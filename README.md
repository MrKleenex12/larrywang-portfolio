The aim of this project is to create a personal website while mastering the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To achieve this, I will follow freeCodeCamp's certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum, combining structured learning with smaller practice projects to refine my skills.

By completing the curriculum, I aspire to develop strong Full Stack development skills and become a more proficient programmer.

Additionally, I plan to host my personal website using GitHub Pages.
