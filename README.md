# larrywang-portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built as part of my journey to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I plan to host it on GitHub Pages when finished.

## Learning Progress

I am following these learning courses:

- freeCodeCamp's [Full Stack Developer Curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) (fcc-FSD) - started 4/12/25
- [Comm 244](http://web.simmons.edu/~grovesd/comm244/): Design for the World Wide Web  - started 5/20/25

I am also interested in following the [Odin Project Paths](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths). After finishing fcc-FSD and Comm 244, I will jump into either the Ruby on Rails or the JavaScript path.

## Current Progress

- fcc-FSD: Forms and Tables (In Progress)
- Comm 244: Week 1 (Finished)

I will update my progress as I learn more.

## Future Goals

- Add interactive JavaScript features
- Complete the Responsive Web Design Certification
- Complete COMM 244: Design for the World Wide Web
- Continue building projects and showcasing them
